   			<p>Hi guys！我是陳宜婕, 很開心你們點擊進入我的網站
				這邊想先跟大家簡短自我介紹一下~</br>

				我目前就讀國立清華大學外國語文學系大四，預計於明年６月畢業後先找工作，計畫工作幾年後再依照自己所需繼續攻讀研究所</br>
				我平常的興趣為跳街舞，大二時曾擔任熱舞社社長，有辦過很多場活動，甚至單場活動有超過 600 人來觀看。我也與交大熱舞社合辦<em>熱舞梅竹賽</em>，邀請許多街舞老師來擔任評審，活動精采度絕對不輸清交的體育梅竹賽！</br>
				而平常的吃美食跟遊山玩水當然也少不了，為了記錄找到的美食，我還創了一個 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/la.la.eating/" target="blank">IG 美食帳</a>來記錄這些食物，如果有興趣的話也可以追蹤一下 XD</br>
				我現在正在微軟(Microsoft)擔任行銷實習生(MOI)，主要負責 B2B 的行銷、文案撰寫、活動企劃等，目前還在邊學邊做，同時也希望能繼續探索更多不同的職涯~

   			<p>Hi guys！I’m Shinna, It’s my pleasure to see you guys click into my website. And I would like to introduce myself to let you know more about me. I am currently a senior in the Department of Foreign Language and Literature at National Tsinghua University, and I expect to find a job after graduating in June next year, and plan to work for a few years before continuing to study for a master’s degree. In my leisure time, practicing street dance is my favorite hobby, and I was the director of the school pop dance club in my sophomore. I held many activities, and even a single activity attracted more than 600 people to watch. I also co-organized the Meichu Competition with the NYCU Pop Dance Club, and invited many famous Taiwanese dancers to be oue judges. The activity was absolutely as exciting as the sports Meichu Competition! In order to record the delicious food I found, I also created an Instagram food account to share those resturants. If you are interested, you can also follow, I am currently working as a Marketing Operation Intern (MOI) at Microsoft, where I am mainly responsible for B2B marketing, copywriting, event planning, etc. I am still learning while doing this, and I also hope to continue to explore more different career possibilities.</p>
