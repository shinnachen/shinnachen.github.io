				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>The article's thesis statement is in the third paragraph of [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], the first sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keywords <q>maintaining forests</q> and the the key phrases <q>they are tough to carry out</q> prescribed burns are key to reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires, but it also can harm nature due to global warming. Scientists are using high-tech tools to ensure they can be done safely in a warming world.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q><span style="background: #80cdc1;">As useful as prescribed burns can be for maintaining forests, they are tough to carry out — costly, labor-intensive, contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather.</span> And even well-planned burns can turn disastrous, as when a fire started by the United States Forest Service this spring was transformed by gusting winds into New Mexico's largest wildfire on record.</q></p>

				<ul> <!-- Unordered list -->
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec2">Sec. #2</a>] - Fire caould be either angel or devil</b>
						<p>The first paragraph start by telling how the scientsts examine wildfire behavior;however, thinning pre-emptively could allow more wind to whip through during a burn, producing hotter flames and making the blaze harder to control. <q>For prescribed fire, I think it's really all out there to be explored</q> and the last paragraph both shows the concern to fire.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec3">Sec. #3</a>] - how to build better fire modeling with the influences of Global warming</b>
						<p>The second paragraph of this section, <q>its methods are failing to keep up as the planet warms.</q> umplys that the method of old fire modeling is no longer comply to nowadyas due to global warming. Therefore, we need to figure out <q>how to burn in increasingly volatile landscapes</q></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec4">Sec. #4</a>] - comparing images from before, during and after the burn can get better understanding of forest fire</b>
						<p>The section describes that how scientists study a wildfire, and some day in the furture <q>such methods could help evaluate how effectively a prescribed fire had burned through the fuels it was supposed to get rid of.</q></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[<a href="example.html#sec5">Sec. #5</a>] - fire is a natural, yet also unnatural way of safeguarding the land</b>
						<p>The section describes the landscape of a artificial wildfire. <q>the brutal raw power of the fire</q> shows the uncertainty of fire, but we still need it to protect our wild.</p>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author writes a successful case of how to crate a wildfire and not to do harm to the forest. And futher describe the scene of burning with purple passage, which aims to emphasize the power of fire. For example, the author quotes Dr. York's words <q>The older I get," he said, "the more I appreciate how much of science is like an art.</q>. And in the previous paragraph, <q>When Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans, he probably didn't imagine how tricky it would be to wield on a planet heated by the burning of fossil fuels.</q>, the sentence also conveys the owe of fire. The reason why author want to emphasizes the fire is to prescribe although burns are key to reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires, it can also be on oppisite due to global warming. Therefore, Scientists are using high-tech tools to ensure they can be done safely in a warming world.Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">We should pay more attention to the global warming to prevent the forest from inappropriate wildfire. On the other hand, figure out a balance of buring forest on perpuse to nurish it is a new lesson for the world.</span>.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>"Fire has made us civilized, but we still don't understand it fully," said Tirtha Banerjee of the University of California, Irvine, as he watched a tall heap of dead tree limbs go up in flames. As useful as prescribed burns can be for maintaining forests, they are tough to carry out — costly, labor-intensive, contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather. And even well-planned burns can turn disastrous, as when a fire started by the United States Forest Service this spring was transformed by gusting winds into New Mexico's largest wildfire on record.</q></p>
